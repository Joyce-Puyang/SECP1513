# REFLECTIONS ðŸ’­
  ### Assignment 1:
  Throughout the virtual industry visit, I learned about the requirements and job specifications for a career in IT. For example, a System Application Product (SAP) technical consultant works in a team to find a solution that meets a client's needs. Inspired by their talk, I aim to leverage my computer skills by mastering various programming languages such as C++, HTML, JavaScript, etc. I hope that at the end of the course, I'll be a knowledgeable and skilful programmer with critical thinking skills. 

  ### Assignment 2:
  Throughout the industry visit at UTMDigital, I gained insight into the organisation structure and the services provided by UTMDigital. One of the highlights from the visit is that I got to interview one of the staff members, Miss Aruslin about her working experience as a programming developer and assistant officer. Overall, my impression of UTMDigital has sparked renewed excitement and interest in pursuing my study in Computer Science.

  ### Assignment 3:
  Based on the talk given by Mr Nik Mohd Habibullah Bin Nik Mohd Nizam, an alumnus of Computer Science from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), I discovered some tips and strategies to prepare entrepreneurship in Information Technology (IT). For instance, he shared his experiences as a Micro Semiconductor Sdn Bhd manager and how he handled his business. He also suggested we define our preferred working environment and research it. All in all, I am eager to apply this knowledge when looking for a suitable career in the next four years. 

  ### Assignment 4:
  Throughout my visit to MaGICX, I got to know about their research development in virtual reality and augmented reality. One of the innovations they made was the VR Lab in which students can conduct hazardous experiments virtually. The experiment was engaging and easy to follow as students used their Oculus and touch controllers to control the activities within the virtual space. Overall, I found this interaction with their innovation so inspiring for me as a Graphic and Multimedia student. 

  ### Design Thinking Project:
  This design thinking enables me to think critically about the problem and find a solution that fits the user's needs. Not only that, design thinking also allows me to work in a team and build my confidence in team management. I am grateful that I can lead my team and successfully create a working prototype to display to others during our presentation.
